        <section class="our-story-section">
            <p class="body-text">Our founders met in college and bonded deeply over our shared desire to create unforgettable celebrations for our families and friends. We are highly skilled event planners who have honed our craft over the past 10 years curating customized experiences for our loved ones.  With Covid-19 redefining the way we gather, we wanted to create healthy spaces that combine luxury, fun, and a little extra breathing room for everyone to enjoy. After obtaining our Master's degrees and entering our independent fields of study we decided to share our true passion for curating customizable moments, bringing convenience and a touch of elegance to your picnic experience and private events.</p>
